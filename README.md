<p> Appointment Tracker is a full stack client and appointment database management application designed to satisfy curriculum requirements in my computer science degree program.</p> 
<p>The application has a fully functional JavaFXML UI and integrates with a MySQL database. Appointment Tracker is capable of converting UTC timestamps in the database to and from
the local time zone of the machine running the program. Other main features include user authentication and modification tracking, appointments are able to be sorted sorted by month or week, and 
there are several useful reports that can be accessed. </p>
<p>Appointment Tracker is not currently under active development</p>
